  title: Letters to a Pre-scientist

    Letters to a pre-scientist connects Stem professionals with students. This is a super rewarding pen pal experience!
    It was really exciting to learn about my pen pal's passions and dreams, and do my best to help grow his love for science!

  title: Princeton EEB Scholars
  text: >+
    The Princeton EEB Scholars Program serves students historically excluded from EEB, and aims to demystify the graduate
    school application process, as well as prepare these students for grad school interviews. I was lucky to be coordinator for two
    years. Image by [Ken Lund](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kenlund/40545844173/)
